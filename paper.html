A key challenge of generating toxicity data is the implementation of a standardized analysis approach for transparent and reproducible benchmark concentration (BMC) estimation and uncertainty quantification for assay developers, regulators, and other stakeholders. In this study, we compared the bioactivity results of 321 chemical samples from four established BMC analysis pipelines used for evaluation of developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) NAMs data: the ToxCast pipeline (tcpl), CRStats, DNT DIVER (Curvep and Hill pipelines). We found an overall activity hit call concordance of 77.2 % and highly correlated BMC estimations (r = 0.92 ± 0.02 SD), demonstrating generally good agreement across pipelines. Discordance appeared to be explained predominantly by noise within the data and borderline activity (activity occuring near the benchmark response level). Evaluation of the BMC confidence intervals indicated that pipeline selection may impact the estimation of the BMC lower bound. Consideration of biphasic models appeared important for capturing biologically-relevant changes in activity in the DNT battery. Lastly, different approaches to compute ‘selective’ bioactivity (activity below the threshold of cytotoxicity) were compared, identifying the CRstats classification model as more stringent for classifying selective activity. Overall, these findings indicated greater confidence in NAMs bioactivity results and emphasize the importance of understanding strengths and uncertainties of concentration–response modeling pipelines for informing biological interpretation and application decision making.</div></details>

How Dox-induced damage either to cardiomyocytes or to cardiac stem cells, which may compromise cardiac regeneration, contributes to cardiotoxicity remains poorly understood.Methods Here we used a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based model system to determine the sensitivity of stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) applying different treatment regimens of Dox. Next to a broad range of methods to determine cellular and mitochondrial functions we performed an in-depth whole genome transcriptome profiling in iPSCs as well as iCMs.Results As compared to their differentiated counterparts, iPSCs are highly sensitive against even short pulse-treatments with low Dox concentrations. Using such rather mild treatment conditions, we observed major mitochondrial impairments as demonstrated by increased mitochondrial fragmentation, persistent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced ATP levels, while neither a markedly increased nuclear DNA damage response nor apoptosis were detected. Albeit mitochondrial dysfunction was not accompanied by changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure or altered OXPHOS complex assembly, mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) organization was altered. This points to a possible role of mtDNA remodelling for contributing to the high susceptibility of iPSCs to Dox. Whole genome transcriptome profiling revealed major differences in the transcriptional response to Dox treatment between iPSCs and iCMs. We could show that a moderate and transient exposure of iPSCs to Dox is sufficient to cause major transcriptional changes as for example reflected by the downregulation of numerous pivotal genes regulating cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism in iPSCs. Furthermore, pulse-treatment with Dox at the iPSC stage, termed preconditioning here, shifts the global transcriptional landscape of iCMs towards the expression of genes associated with impaired cardiac muscle regeneration, disrupted energy metabolism, altered muscle contraction, and increased fibrosis.Conclusions Our findings support the hypothesis that Dox-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and transcriptional preconditioning in stem cells results in an impaired regenerative capacity after differentiation. This highlights a potential critical role of stem cells in mediating Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.CSCCardiac stem cellCMCardiomyocyteDDRDNA damage responseDSBDNA double-strand breakDoxDoxorubicinEtoEtoposideCCCPCarbonylcyanid-m-chlorphenylhydrazoniCMsiPSC-derived cardiomyocytesiPSCinduced pluripotent stem cellMtMock-treatedmtDNAMitochondrial DNAMTT(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) tetrazoliumSRBSulforhodamine B</div></details>

                            <details class="paper-abstract-details"><summary>Abstract</summary><div class="paper-abstract">Despite growing awareness of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), knowledge gaps remain regarding their effects on human brain development. EDC risk assessment focuses primarily on EATS modalities (estrogens, androgens, thyroid hormones, and steroidogenesis), overlooking the broader range of hormone receptors expressed in the developing brain. This limits the evaluation of chemicals for their potential to cause endocrine disruption-mediated developmental neurotoxicity (ED-DNT). The Neurosphere Assay, an in vitro test method for developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) evaluation, is an integral component of the DNT in vitro testing battery, which has been used to screen a broad domain of environmental chemicals. Here, we define the endocrine-related applicability domain of the Neurosphere Assay by assessing the impact and specificity of 14 hormone receptors on seven key neurodevelopmental processes (KNDPs), neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation, migration of radial glia, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, neurite outgrowth, and differentiation of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Comparative analyses in human and rat NPCs of both sexes revealed species- and sex-specific responses. Mechanistic insights were obtained through RNA sequencing and agonist/antagonist co-exposures. Most receptor agonists modulated KNDPs at concentrations in the range of physiologically relevant hormone concentrations. Phenotypic effects induced by glucocorticoid receptor (GR), liver X receptor (LXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARβδ), retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) activation were counteracted by receptor antagonists, confirming specificity. Transcriptomics highlighted receptor crosstalk and the involvement of conserved developmental pathways (e.g. Notch and Wnt). Species comparisons identified limited concordance in hormone receptor-regulated KNDPs between human and rat NPCs. This study presents novel findings on cellular and molecular hormone actions in human fetal NPCs, highlights major species differences, and illustrates the Neurosphere Assay’s relevance for detecting endocrine MoAs, supporting its application in human-based ED-DNT risk assessment.</div></details>

The data processing pipeline provided in the test method description is often highly complex. Usually, multiple layers of data, ranging from a machine-generated output to the final hit definition, are considered. Transition between each of these layers often requires several data processing steps. As changes in any of these processing steps can impact the final output of new approach methods (NAMs), the processing pipeline is an essential part of a NAM description and should be included in reporting templates such as the ToxTemp. The same raw data, processed in different ways, may result in different final outcomes that may affect the readiness status and regulatory acceptance of the NAM, as an altered output can affect robustness, performance, and relevance. Data management, pro­cessing, and interpretation are therefore important elements of a comprehensive NAM definition.

In addition, we illustrate data processing and evaluation steps between these data levels.

Endo­crine-disrupting chemicals can interfere with the hormonal milieu during this critical time-period, disrupting key neurodevelopmental processes. Hence, there is a need for the development of assays that evaluate developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) induced by an endocrine mode of action. Herein, we evaluated the neural progenitor C17.2 cell line as an <em>in vitro </em>test system to aid in the detection of endocrine disruption-induced DNT. For this, C17.2 cells were exposed during 10 days of dif­ferentiation to agonists and antagonists of the thyroid hormone (THR), glucocorticoid (GR), retinoic acid (RAR), retinoic x (RXR), oxysterol (LXR), estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), and peroxisome prolif­erator activated delta (PPARβ/δ) receptors, as well as to the agonist of the vitamin D (VDR) receptor. Upon exposure and differentiation, neuronal morphology (neurite outgrowth and branching) and the percentage of neurons in culture were assessed by immunofluorescence. For this, the cells were stained for βIII-tubulin (neuronal marker). C17.2 cells decreased neurite outgrowth and branching in response to RAR, RXR and PPARβ/δ agonists. Exposure to the GR agonist increased the number of cells differentiating into neurons, while exposure to the RXR agonist had the opposite effect. With this approach, we demonstrate that C17.2 cells are responsive to GR, RAR, RXR, and PPARβ/δ agonists and hence could be useful to develop a test system for hazard assessment of endocrine disruption-induced DNT.</p><p><strong>Plain language summary <br /></strong>Hormones play a vital role for an organism’s development, including brain development. Endo­crine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) interfere with the hormone system. Exposure to EDCs while a fetus is developing can cause a toxic effect on the nervous system called developmental neurotoxicity (DNT). In Europe, the use of chemicals shown to be EDCs may be restricted. Animal tests for devel­opmental neurotoxicity require many animals but cannot determine whether a chemical causes DNT via endocrine disruption or other mechanisms. We have developed a method to identify endocrine disruption-caused DNT using a mouse nerve cell line. In culture, these cells extend long processes called neurites that branch out, and we can measure the length and branching rate of the neurites. We show that this maturation process is dependent on hormonal signals and can therefore be used to identify chemicals that interfere with nerve cell maturation via these signals.</p></div></details>

This implies that we need to assess their similarity to apply what we have learned from one experience to another. It is proposed that we “cluster” our experiences based on (hidden) <em>latent causes</em> that we infer. It is also suggested that surprises, which occur when our predictions are incorrect, help us categorize our experiences into distinct groups. In this paper, we develop a computational theory that emulates these processes based on two basic concepts from intuitive physics and Gestalt psychology using symmetry and geometry. We apply our approach to simple tasks that involve inductive reasoning. Remarkably, the output of our computational approach aligns closely with human responses.</div></details>

                            <details class="paper-abstract-details"><summary>Abstract</summary><div class="paper-abstract">The currently accepted methods for neurotoxicity (NT) testing rely on animal studies. However, high costs and low testing throughput hinder their application for large numbers of chemicals. To overcome these limitations, in vitro methods are currently being developed based on human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) that allow higher testing throughput at lower costs. We applied six different protocols to generate 3D BrainSphere models for acute NT evaluation. These include three different media for 2D neural induction and two media for subsequent 3D differentiation resulting in self-organized, organotypic neuron/astrocyte microtissues. All induction protocols yielded nearly 100% NESTIN-positive hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hiNPCs), though with different gene expression profiles concerning regional patterning. Moreover, gene expression and immunocytochemistry analyses revealed that the choice of media determines neural differentiation patterns. On the functional level, BrainSpheres exhibited different levels of electrical activity on microelectrode arrays (MEA). Spike sorting allowed BrainSphere functional characterization with the mixed cultures consisting of GABAergic, glutamatergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic neurons. A test method for acute NT testing, the human multi-neurotransmitter receptor (hMNR) assay, was proposed to apply such MEA-based spike sorting. These models are promising tools not only in toxicology but also for drug development and disease modeling.</div></details>

If at least one KNDP is affected by a chemical, an adverse outcome is expected. To enable a higher testing throughput than the guideline animal experiments, a developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) <em>in vitro </em>testing battery (DNT IVB) comprising a variety of assays that model several KNDPs was set up. Gap analysis revealed the need for a human-based assay to assess neural network formation and function (NNF). Therefore, we established the human NNF (hNNF) assay. A co-culture comprised of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as primary human astroglia was differentiated for 35 days on microelectrode arrays (MEA), and spontaneous electrical activity, together with cytotoxicity, was assessed on a weekly basis after washout of the compounds 24 h prior to measurements. In addition to the characterization of the test system, the assay was challenged with 28 com­pounds, mainly pesticides, identifying their DNT potential by evaluating specific spike-, burst-, and network parameters. This approach confirmed the suitability of the assay for screening environmental chemicals. Comparison of benchmark con­centrations (BMC) with an NNF <em>in vitro </em>assay (rNNF) based on primary rat cortical cells revealed differences in sensitivity. Together with the successful implementation of hNNF data into a postulated stressor-specific adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network associated with a plausible molecular initiating event for deltamethrin, this study suggests the hNNF assay as a useful complement to the DNT IVB.</p></div></details>

                            <details class="paper-abstract-details"><summary>Abstract</summary><div class="paper-abstract">Developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) is a major safety concern for all chemicals of the human exposome. However, DNT data from animal studies are available for only a small percentage of manufactured compounds. Test methods with a higher throughput than current regulatory guideline methods, and with improved human relevance are urgently needed. We therefore explored the feasibility of DNT hazard assessment based on new approach methods (NAMs). An in vitro battery (IVB) was assembled from ten individual NAMs that had been developed during the past years to probe effects of chemicals on various fundamental neurodevelopmental processes. All assays used human neural cells at different developmental stages. This allowed us to assess disturbances of: (i) proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPC); (ii) migration of neural crest cells, radial glia cells, neurons and oligodendrocytes; (iii) differentiation of NPC into neurons and oligodendrocytes; and (iv) neurite outgrowth of peripheral and central neurons. In parallel, cytotoxicity measures were obtained. The feasibility of concentration-dependent screening and of a reliable biostatistical processing of the complex multi-dimensional data was explored with a set of 120 test compounds, containing subsets of pre-defined positive and negative DNT compounds. The battery provided alerts (hit or borderline) for 24 of 28 known toxicants (82% sensitivity), and for none of the 17 negative controls. Based on the results from this screen project, strategies were developed on how IVB data may be used in the context of risk assessment scenarios employing integrated approaches for testing and assessment (IATA).</div></details>

Test guidelines for reproductive and developmental toxicity rely mainly on animal studies, which make up the majority of animal usage in regulatory toxicology. Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative in vitro methods to follow the 3R principles. To improve human safety, cell models based on human cells are of great interest to overcome species differences. Here, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are an ideal cell source as they largely recapitulate embryonic stem cells without bearing ethical concerns and they are able to differentiate into most cell types of the human body. Here, we set up and characterized a fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free hiPSC-based in vitro test method, called the human induced pluripotent stem cell test (hiPS Test), to evaluate the embryotoxic potential of substances. After 10 days in culture, hiPSCs develop into beating cardiomyocytes. As terminal endpoint evaluations, cell viability, qPCR analyses as well as beating frequency and area of beating cardiomyocytes by video analyses are measured. The embryotoxic positive and non-embryotoxic negative controls, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and Penicillin G (PenG), respectively, were correctly assessed in the hiPS Test. More compounds need to be screened in the future for defining the assay’s applicability domain, which will inform us of the suitability of the hiPS Test for detecting adverse effects of substances on embryonic development.</div></details>

The methods underwent afit-for-purpose evaluation that considered four key elements: 1. The test system, 2. the exposure scheme, 3. the assay and analytical endpoint(s) and 4. the classification model. This testing battery was challenged with 119 chemicals for which rich toxicological information was available (for some of them also on their DNT hazard). Testing was performed in 5 test systems measuring 10 DNT-specific endpoints and additional 9 viability/cytotoxicity-related parameters. For approximately half of the compounds, additional and complementary data from DNT in vitro tests was added by the US-EPA. This extended battery was also evaluated. Testing results revealed that the test methods of this current DNT in vitro battery are reliable and reproducible. The endpoints had to a large extent low redundancy. Battery performance, as assessed with compounds well-characterized for DNT hazard had a sensitivity of 82.7\% and a specificity of 88.2\%. Gap analyses suggested that radial, astro- and microglia as well as myelination endpoints may be added to the battery. Two case studies, one for screening and prioritization of 14 flame retardants, and one on hazard characterization of 2 pesticides, were presented. Hypothetical AOPs were developed based on the latter case study.In conclusion, the DNT testing strategy explored here is a very promising first approach for DNT hazard identification and characterization. The performance is encouraging and may be improved by inclusion of further tests. Some uncertainties in DNTin vitro battery testing outcomes could be reduced by incorporating test data and modelling approaches related to in vitro and in vivo toxicokinetics of test compounds.</div></details>
