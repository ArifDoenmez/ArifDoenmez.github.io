          I’m a postdoctoral researcher in the group for Alternative method development for environmental toxicity testing of Prof. Dr. Ellen Fritsche at the IUF – Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine. We're on a mission to develop in vitro test methods for animal-free screening of chemicals, regarding their potential to disturb brain development and cause developmental neurotoxicity (DNT). I'm also working in the Bioinformatics working group of Prof. Dr. Axel Mosig at Ruhr University Bochum, Department of Biophysics, where I supervise work on applications of deep learning to biomedical image analysis and computational biostatistics. My research interests span artificial intelligence, machine learning, and scientific computing.

          Before joining IUF, I was a PhD student in the Algebra working group of Prof. Dr. Markus Reineke at Ruhr University Bochum, where I worked on geometric approaches to linear algebra type classification problems. We studied geometric properties of quiver moduli spaces with topological, arithmetic, algebraic, and homological methods.

          Current research interests include the development of interacting particle systems for computational problems raised from topics in experimental toxicology and connections between noncommutative geometry and unsupervised learning.
